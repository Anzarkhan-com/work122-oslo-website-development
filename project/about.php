            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p style="color:black">The Oslo Colour Festival is organized by IndoNord - The Association of Indo-Norwegian Diaspora in Norway.

We are eager to share and showcase the cultural gifts of India along with our friends in Norway. The contributions of our range of partners, who share our enthusiasm, play an important role in our efforts to spread our love, unity, diversity, and togetherness.</p>
